# True North Forward Operating Base (TN-FOB)

## Mission

**17 veterans die by suicide every day.**

When a veteran is in crisis, they don't call a hotline—they text their battle buddy. But that buddy has no tools and no backup.

**Forward Operating Base gives the helping veteran instant access to local resources, evidence-based responses, and warm handoff to peer counselors.**

We're not building another app for veterans in crisis. **We're building tools for veterans who help other veterans.**
