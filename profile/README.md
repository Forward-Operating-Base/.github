**Motto:** *OWN THE OUTCOME*

---

## Overview

True North Forward Operating Base is a veteran-focused nonprofit support platform built on the same Command architecture as TNDS Command Center. TN-FOB provides tools and resources across six pillars of veteran support, with a flagship focus on peer support and crisis intervention.

---

## The Mission

**17 veterans die by suicide every day.**

When a veteran is in crisis, they don't call a hotline—they text their battle buddy. But that buddy has no tools and no backup.

Forward Operating Base gives the helping veteran instant access to local resources, evidence-based responses, and warm handoff to peer counselors.

**We're not building another app for veterans in crisis. We're building tools for veterans who help other veterans.**

---

## Naming Convention

TN-FOB follows the same Command naming pattern as TNDS Command Center:

- **Module Pattern:** [Function] Command
- **Pillar Structure:** Six pillars of veteran support
- **Shared Commands:** GovCon Command and Proposal Command shared with TNDS
