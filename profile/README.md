## Overview

Forward Operating Base (TN-FOB) is a veteran-focused nonprofit support platform built using the same Command architecture that powers True North Data Strategies.

TN-FOB delivers structured, technology-enabled support across six pillars of veteran stability — with a flagship focus on peer support and crisis response.

This is not another veteran app.

This is infrastructure for the veterans who help other veterans.

---

## The Mission

**17 veterans die by suicide every day.**

When a veteran is in crisis, they do not open a new platform.
They text their battle buddy.

But that battle buddy has no tools.
No structure.
No backup.

Forward Operating Base equips the helping veteran with:

- Immediate peer-response tools  
- Evidence-based crisis guidance  
- Local resource mapping  
- Warm handoff to professional support  
- A no-wrong-door escalation model  

We are building the system behind the moment.

## Platform Architecture

TN-FOB operates on a Command-based modular architecture:

- Structured modules (“Commands”)
- Six operational pillars
- Shared infrastructure with TNDS
- Security and governance by design

Each module can operate independently or integrate into the broader FOB ecosystem.

## Flagship Module

### Peer-Support Rapid Connect

The Battle Buddy System is the core innovation of TN-FOB.

When a veteran reaches out:

- Their peer gets guided response tools instantly  
- Crisis scenarios include evidence-based scripts  
- Local VA and community resources are mapped in real time  
- Escalation to trained peer counselors is seamless  
- Every interaction routes to help — not friction
